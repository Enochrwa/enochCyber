## Analysis of Missing or Incomplete Features from docs/isimbi.txt

This document lists features, objectives, or requirements mentioned in `docs/isimbi.txt` that appear to be either missing or not fully implemented in the `backend/` or `eCyber/` codebase, based on a review of the document (Chapters 1, 3, 4) and previous codebase analysis.

1.  **Feature:** Advanced Device Isolation (beyond IP blocking)
    *   **Description:** The capability to fully isolate a compromised device from the network, potentially by interacting with Network Access Control (NAC) systems or reconfiguring switch ports to assign the device to a quarantine VLAN. This is more comprehensive than simple IP-based blocking.
    *   **Mentioned in:**
        *   Specific Objective 1.3.2.d: "...isolating compromised devices."
        *   (Implicitly) Expected Results 1.10: "...quarantining affected devices, isolating compromised network segments..."
    *   **Assessment:** The presence of `backend/api/nac_api.py` suggests an intent or a foundational element for this. However, Chapter 4 does not detail its full implementation for device quarantine.
    *   **Implementation Estimate:** Primarily Backend (significant logic to interface with various network hardware or NAC solutions via `nac_api.py`). Frontend would need controls to initiate/manage isolation and display device status.

2.  **Feature:** User-Centric Behavioral Anomaly Detection
    *   **Description:** Monitoring and establishing baselines for individual user activities (e.g., login patterns, resource access, application usage) across the network to detect anomalies that deviate from a specific user's typical behavior, as opposed to general network anomalies.
    *   **Mentioned in:**
        *   Specific Objective 1.3.2.f: "To Integrate Behavioral Analysis Techniques â€“ Monitor user and network behavior to detect anomalies that may indicate cyber threats." (The "user behavior" part is key here).
    *   **Assessment:** Chapter 4 and the codebase (`backend/ml/`) show a strong focus on network traffic anomaly detection. While user authentication is present, dedicated modules for tracking and analyzing specific user behaviors across different data sources for anomaly detection are not explicitly detailed as implemented.
    *   **Implementation Estimate:** Both. Backend would require new data ingestion pathways for user activity logs, development of user-specific ML profiling models. Frontend would need to visualize user risk profiles and user-specific behavioral anomalies.

3.  **Feature:** Advanced SIEM Log Correlation Engine
    *   **Description:** A sophisticated and configurable engine for automatically correlating diverse logs (e.g., from network devices, servers, applications, identity providers) to identify complex, multi-stage attack patterns and provide a higher-level understanding of security incidents, reducing alert fatigue from individual, uncorrelated events.
    *   **Mentioned in:**
        *   Specific Objective 1.3.2.g: "...correlate security logs for centralized threat intelligence and reporting."
        *   Chapter 3.4.4 (Data Analysis): "Alert Correlation: The system aims to correlate alerts from different detection mechanisms..."
        *   Chapter 5.1 (Conclusion) mentions "SIEM-like Functionality."
    *   **Assessment:** The system collects and displays logs and alerts. Basic correlation might be implicitly handled by services like `backend/app/services/threat_analysis_service.py`. However, a dedicated, advanced correlation engine with configurable rules and the ability to ingest and normalize a wide array of external log sources is a substantial feature not fully detailed as complete in Chapter 4.
    *   **Implementation Estimate:** Primarily Backend (developing a complex event processing engine, defining correlation logic and rules, creating parsers for various log formats, potentially new database structures for correlated events). Frontend would be needed for rule configuration and visualizing correlated attack timelines or graphs.

4.  **Feature:** High Availability / Fault Tolerance Mechanisms
    *   **Description:** Application-level mechanisms ensuring continuous operation of the security monitoring system, such as failover for critical backend components (e.g., packet analysis engine, API server, database) or load balancing strategies designed within the application architecture itself.
    *   **Mentioned in:**
        *   Non-Functional Requirement 3.7.3 (Chapter 3): "Ensure 99.9% system uptime with fault-tolerant mechanisms. Implement failover strategies to maintain availability."
    *   **Assessment:** Chapter 4 mentions general robustness but does not detail specific fault tolerance or failover strategies implemented within the application code. While some of this can be handled by external infrastructure (e.g., Kubernetes), application-level awareness or mechanisms are often required for seamless failover.
    *   **Implementation Estimate:** Primarily Backend (implementing health checks, state replication if needed, leader election for services, database clustering awareness). Frontend might include a status page to show the health of backend components/cluster.

5.  **Feature:** Geographical Map Visualization of Attacks
    *   **Description:** An interactive map integrated into the `eCyber` dashboard displaying the geographical source of detected external attacks, based on IP address geolocation.
    *   **Mentioned in:**
        *   Chapter 4.5 (Presentation of Findings and Results): "...potentially geographical maps of attack origins (if `backend/app/utils/geo_utils.py` is fully integrated with UI)."
    *   **Assessment:** The backend utility `backend/app/utils/geo_utils.py` exists, indicating a foundation for geolocation. However, the frontend implementation of a map component to visualize this data is not explicitly confirmed in Chapter 4's description of the dashboard.
    *   **Implementation Estimate:** Primarily Frontend (integrating a mapping library, designing the map component, fetching and displaying geolocated attack data from an API endpoint). Backend would need to ensure the `geo_utils.py` is robust and the API endpoint for this data is available.

6.  **Feature:** Mechanisms for Updating and Retraining ML Models (User-Driven)
    *   **Description:** Clear UI/API driven mechanisms for administrators to trigger or schedule the retraining of ML models (`backend/ml/train.py`) with new data, and to manage different versions of models.
    *   **Mentioned in:**
        *   Functional Requirement 3.6.3 (Chapter 3): "Provide mechanisms for updating and retraining models as new data becomes available."
    *   **Assessment:** `backend/ml/train.py` exists for training. Chapter 4.3.3 mentions "model training (offline or periodically)". However, the user-facing mechanisms (API endpoints and UI in `eCyber/src/pages/Models.tsx`) for an administrator to easily manage this process (e.g., initiate retraining, select data, activate a new model) are not fully detailed.
    *   **Implementation Estimate:** Both. Backend would need robust APIs for managing the model lifecycle (triggering training, versioning, deploying). Frontend would need UI elements in the `Models.tsx` page or a dedicated settings area for these actions.
